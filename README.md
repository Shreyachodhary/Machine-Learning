## 📌 Repository Highlights

This repository includes practical implementations and walkthroughs of:

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing

* **Handling Missing Values**
  Techniques such as imputation using mean, median, mode, and conditional logic based on feature relationships.

* **Data Standardization**
  Scaling features using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` to improve model performance and convergence.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  Use of Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for statistical summaries and data visualization.

### 🔹 Data Access & Integration

* **Using the Kaggle API**
  Learn how to authenticate and download datasets programmatically for seamless integration into your ML projects.

* **Efficient Use of Pandas**
  Comprehensive examples of data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and transformation.
