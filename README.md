# 🧠 Machine Learning Basics with Python

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This project is a hands-on collection of essential machine learning preprocessing techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It's designed for beginners who want to get started with data science and machine learning by understanding the foundational steps.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of data handling and preprocessing:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 📦 `Importing_Datasets_through_Kaggle_API.ipynb` | Learn how to use the Kaggle API to fetch datasets directly into your workflow. |
| 🧼 `Handling_missing_values_in_machine_learning_.ipynb` | Explore techniques to handle and impute missing values in datasets. |
| 📊 `Data_Standardization.ipynb` | Standardize features so they have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 — a critical preprocessing step. |
| 🐼 `Pandas_library.ipynb` | Get familiar with the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyachodhary/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning
````

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can manually install common dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
