## 📊 Models Implemented

### 1. Linear Regression

**Purpose:** Predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.

**Key Features:**

* Assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the target.
* Implemented using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`.

**Usage:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 2. Logistic Regression

**Purpose:** Classify data into binary or multiclass categories.

**Key Features:**

* Models the probability of class membership.
* Utilizes the logistic (sigmoid) function.
* Implemented using `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn`.

**Usage:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Purpose:** Perform classification or regression by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points.

**Key Features:**

* Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
* Utilizes kernel functions for non-linear classification.
* Implemented using `SVC` for classification and `SVR` for regression from `scikit-learn`.

**Usage:**

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

model = SVC(kernel='linear')  # Options: 'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 4. Lasso Regression

**Purpose:** Perform linear regression with L1 regularization to enhance model simplicity and prevent overfitting.

**Key Features:**

* Encourages sparsity in the model coefficients.
* Useful for feature selection.
* Implemented using `Lasso` from `scikit-learn`.

**Usage:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
